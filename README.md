# ProcessVideo_LaMaMa
The following script is designed for processing video files at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club Archive.  

# Background
In fall 2020, I had my internship at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club Archive. My job responsibilities included: make preservation master files and access files out of video recordings of each staged performance (the video recordings were derived from Sony digital cameras); and catalogue each video recording of performance, each performance production, and each performance word (a cataloguing hierarchy designed according to the FRBR model).  
Because digital cameras store video files and their accompanying metadata files according to a specific fild folder arrangement, to view and retrieve each video file, users need to go over a number of file folder layers, a process that causes time and labor. Usually, capturing one stage performance will generate more than one video file. In this case, if a user intends to view a full record of the stage show, he/she will need to repeat the above procedure multiple times in order to retrieve every single video file that records different segments of the stage show.   
The file folder arrange of Sony digitla camera (the model La MaMa uses is PMW-EX3) as as below:
